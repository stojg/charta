This manual will explain how to use the SilverStripe Platform™ Emotion kit.

## Operation of Emotion Kit

#### tl;dr

> Put Red or Pink fluffy ball into vase when frustrated or a Blue or White if you feel that the Platform is better or worse compared to CWP or Webdrive / bespoke platform.

When you are working with the SilverStripe platform™ you will experience different moods, from elated happiness to darkest depression. The Vase of Emotions is meant to record these  feelings.

When being frustrated or struggling to use the SilverStripe platform™ pick a `Red` or `Pink` Pom-Pom of Emotion from the Jar of Holding and slam dunk it into Vase of Emotions.

When you feel that the platform is making your work easier and enjoyable pick a `Blue` or `White` Pom-Pom of Emotion from the Jar of Holding and gently position it into the Vase of Emotions.

If you have any further comment that can be added, write it on a Note of Feedback and drop it into the Vase of Emotions.

A certified member of the CloudBuster will collect and count the Pom-Poms of Emotions on a weekly schedule.

Before choosing a Pom-Pom of Mood, think about if the SilverStripe Platform™ better or worse then Bespoke or CWP Platform.
